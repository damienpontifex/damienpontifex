### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Damien (also known as Ponti to friends) - someone who finds joy their work when helping others or solving problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at WooliesX as a Principal Engineer. My role involves Azure infrastructure, DevOps, Kubernetes and development with many teams to design, plan, monitor and optimise software
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning topics to pass Azure architect exams and looking to apply rust to more projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding the circle of which I can pass on knowledge and help others. I find myself restricting myself to working with small teams at work, but would love to share and colaborate more widely with a general audience
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DevOps, .NET, ML with computer vision or time series data
